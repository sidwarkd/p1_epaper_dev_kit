# Simple Clock Example - P1 E-Paper Dev Kit

This example is a simple clock display that updates every second. It illustrates the fast partial update capabilities of the e-paper display.

The easiest way to get started with this project is to open it in the [Particle Workbench](https://docs.particle.io/tutorials/developer-tools/workbench/) where you can edit it, build it, and flash it to the dev kit.
