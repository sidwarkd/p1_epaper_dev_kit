# GxEPD2_PP
## Particle Display Library for SPI E-Paper Displays

- With full Graphics and Text support using Adafruit_GFX  (Adafruit_GFX_RK Version 1.3.5)

- For SPI e-paper displays from Dalian Good Display 
- and SPI e-paper boards from Waveshare

### important note :
- the display panels are for 3.3V supply and 3.3V data lines
- never connect data lines directly to 5V data pins.
- the actual Waveshare display boards now have level converters and series regulator, safe for 5V

### Paged Drawing, Picture Loop
 - This library uses paged drawing to limit RAM use and cope with missing single pixel update support
 - buffer size can be selected in the application by template parameter page_height, see GxEPD2_Example
 - Paged drawing is implemented as picture loop, like in U8G2 (Oliver Kraus)
 - see https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib/wiki/tpictureloop
 - Paged drawing is also available using drawPaged() and drawCallback(), like in GxEPD
- ` // GxEPD style paged drawing; drawCallback() is called as many times as needed `
- ` void drawPaged(void (*drawCallback)(const void*), const void* pv) `
- paged drawing is done using Adafruit_GFX methods inside picture loop or drawCallback

### Full Screen Buffer Support
 - full screen buffer is selected by setting template parameter page_height to display height
 - drawing to full screen buffer is done using Adafruit_GFX methods without picture loop or drawCallback
 - and then calling method display()

### Low Level Bitmap Drawing Support
 - bitmap drawing support to the controller memory and screen is available:
 - either through the template class instance methods that forward calls to the base display class
 - or directy using an instance of a base display class and calling its methods directly

### Note on documentation
- GxEPD2 uses Adafruit_GFX for Graphics and Text support, which is well documented there
- GxEPD2 uses meaningful method names, and has some comments in the header files
- consult the header files GxEPD2_BW.h, GxEPD2_3C.h and GxEPD2_GFX.h

### Version 1.1.9
- last version for GxEPD2_PP
- corresponds to GxEPD2 Version 1.2.0
- please use GxEPD2 for new projects
#### Version 1.1.0+
- added GxEPD2_PP_WiFi_Example, for bitmap download from web
- only download from http: works, would need help for https:
- only on GitHub, to avoid the need to increase the version for publish
- this is preliminary!
#### Version 1.1.0
- corresponds to GxEPD2 Version 1.1.6
- added support for GDEH0213B72 2.13" b/w, replacement for GDE0213B1
#### Version 1.0.9
- added support for GDEW029T5
- fixed (added) clipping for partial window
- fixed (added) powerOff() after full update (partial update keeps power on)
- added hibernate() for minimum power use by displays that support it
#### Version 1.0.8
- retired, wrong dependency in GxEPD2_PP_Example
#### Version 1.0.7
- fix drawImage(...) overloaded methods signature matching abiguity
- preliminary version
#### Version 1.0.6
- preliminary version
- based on GxEPD2 Version 1.1.0
