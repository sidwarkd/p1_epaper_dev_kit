# Simple Weather Display

This example illustrates how the dev kit can communicate with web API's to get and display data. The sample connects to the [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) API. It requires a free account with OpenWeather. If you don't want to create an account there is a static JSON variable in the sample code that can be used instead.
